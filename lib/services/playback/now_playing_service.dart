/// The shell's playback seam: the one-way channel between whatever owns playback
/// and the shell's now playing bar.
///
/// **One direction, deliberately.** The surface that owns playback pushes state
/// with [NowPlayingService.publish] and registers a [NowPlayingCommands]
/// implementation with [NowPlayingService.register]. The shell only ever reads
/// [NowPlayingService.current] and calls the delegating statics. Nothing here
/// polls a player, asks a player for its position, or knows what a player is.
///
/// That is what keeps the file importable from a plain widget test and stops it
/// growing a cycle back into the pages that mount the shell, which is why no
/// concrete player is imported here: music goes through
/// `music_now_playing_bridge.dart` and the audiobook screen registers itself
/// while its route is open. Adding a third playback surface later costs one
/// adapter and no changes to this file, because the bar cannot tell the owners
/// apart.
///
/// **Owners are a stack, not a slot.** Two owners coexist in normal use: the
/// music bridge registers at boot and lives as long as the process, while the
/// audiobook player registers and unregisters as its route opens and closes.
/// [NowPlayingService.register] therefore moves an owner to the top of an ordered
/// stack and [NowPlayingService.unregister] removes it wherever it sits, so the
/// transient screen's dispose hands the commands back to the bridge with no
/// cooperation from either owner: neither has to ask whether the other is
/// playing, which is the coupling this seam exists to prevent.
///
/// `material.dart` is the only import, and it is there for [BuildContext]:
/// [ValueNotifier] and [immutable] reach this file through its re-export of
/// `foundation`, so a second import directive would be dead weight.
